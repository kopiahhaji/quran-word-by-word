# 🚀 CORS Solution Setup Guide

You have **TWO CORS solutions** implemented in your project. Choose the one that works best for you:

## 🌟 **Option 1: Cloudflare Worker (RECOMMENDED)**

### **Step 1: Create Cloudflare Worker**
1. Go to [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/)
2. Click "Create a Worker"
3. Replace the default code with the content from `worker-cors-proxy.js`
4. Deploy your worker

### **Step 2: Update Your Configuration**

✅ **COMPLETED**: Your worker URL has been configured!

- **Your Worker URL**: `https://quran-api-proxy.rodhirahman30.workers.dev`
- **Configuration**: Already updated in `src/data/websiteSettings.js`

### **Step 3: Test Your Setup**
1. Deploy your changes to Cloudflare Pages
2. Visit `https://quran.zikirnurani.com`
3. Check browser console - CORS errors should be gone!

## 🔄 **Option 2: Public CORS Proxy (Current Fallback)**

This is already configured and working as a fallback! Your app will automatically use:
- `https://api.allorigins.win/raw?url=` as a CORS proxy
- This works immediately but relies on a third-party service

---

## 🔧 **Current Implementation Status**

✅ **CORS proxy detection**: Automatically enabled for `quran.zikirnurani.com`
✅ **API calls updated**: All fetch calls use `getApiUrl()` function
✅ **Fallback ready**: Public CORS proxy configured
✅ **Development friendly**: Direct API calls when running locally

## 🏃‍♂️ **Quick Test**

To test the current setup (with public proxy):
1. Build and deploy your current code
2. Visit your site at `https://quran.zikirnurani.com`
3. Check if the CORS errors are resolved

## 📊 **Performance Comparison**

| Solution | Speed | Reliability | Setup Effort |
|----------|-------|-------------|--------------|
| Cloudflare Worker | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Medium |
| Public CORS Proxy | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | None (already done) |

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

**If CORS errors persist:**
1. Check browser console for exact error messages
2. Verify your domain name in `websiteSettings.js` matches your actual domain
3. Clear browser cache and try again
4. Test with browser dev tools network tab to see which URLs are being called

**Worker not working?**
1. Ensure worker URL doesn't contain 'your-worker-name'
2. Check worker logs in Cloudflare dashboard
3. Verify worker is deployed and accessible

## 💡 **Recommendation**

**Start with Option 2** (already working) to immediately fix CORS, then **upgrade to Option 1** for better performance when you have time to set up the Cloudflare Worker.
